# Testing Java with JUnit 5 & Mockito 

These are personal notes on the Udemy course "Testing Java with JUnit 5 & Mockito" by Sergey Kargopolov.

## Section 1: Introduction

This part is more theoretical.
Here the course first explains what a unit test is in general.
It is mentioned that unit tests are very fast because mocks/fakes/spies are mostly used when dependencies exist.
The following reasons are given why we should write unit tests:
* Make sure the code works
* Code works with valid and invalid input parameters
* Code works now and in the future
* Other code still works even after you made changes (Regression Testing)
